# ISP-Home-Network-Troubleshooting-Simulation-using-Cisco-Packet-Tracer

### Scenario:
A customer wants to host a game server at home but cannot connect from the outside. You, as an ISP Support/Network Engineer I, will:

- Identify missing port forwarding & NAT config
- Configure DHCP & NAT overload (PAT) on the router
- Configure port forwarding to the internal server
- Test and verify connectivity

### What We’re Doing:
We will build a simple network to simulate a home environment:

[PC0] ←→ [Switch0] ←→ [Router0] ←→ [Cloud/Router1]
                      |
                  [Server0]
